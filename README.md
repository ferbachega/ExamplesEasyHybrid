Examples of enzymatic reactions modeled by hybrid potentials QM / MM using pDynamo / EasyHybrid computational tools

	01 shikimate 5-dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (new!)
	02 Adenosine Kinese from mus musculus     (new!)
	03 L-lactate dehydrogenase from Thermus caldophilus  *
	04 b-phosphoglucomutase enzyme from Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis **
	05 Aloalkane dehalogenase   from  xanthobacter autotrophicus *
	06 troy?

Those * are based on works already published.
** we  revisited the paper that you and Ramon Crehuet published. We made something similar but only using SMOs ( good results, by the way).
